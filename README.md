After a lot of trial end error working through a few other code projects and a couple different controllers.
I have compiled a complete working yaml for esp32 in espHome reading all the register values from the Renogy series MPPT Solar Charge Controllers.
I have two different controllers, one is RS485 and the other is RS232.
Included is both data connections for rs232 and rs485, simply comment out or remove which one you dont need and adjust your uart pins as necessary.
All the registers should stay the same between models.
I dont have a model with the load switching, so I cannot verify the registers work!
